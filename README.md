LZ v.0.5.1
===========

LZ is a chocolate JavaScript library.

It gives more than 40 utility methods. The working of the methods does
not depend on the environment. They will work in any JavaScript engine
in same way.

Most of the methods are generic. It means they will work with structural
same objects regardless of their specific type.  
 For example any array method is applicable and on array like objects as
`arguments`.

Some of the methods are polyfills of the functionality in the future
version of the ECMAScript.  
 Those methods use built-ins if they are presented, otherwise robust
polyfill.

The names of the methods are as short as possible and self explanatory
as well.
